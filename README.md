# Auth-Study

A full-stack application demonstrating user authentication using a Node.js backend with Express and Prisma, and a React frontend with TypeScript.

## Overview

The `auth-study` project is a full-stack web application designed to implement and showcase user authentication. It consists of two main components:
- **auth-back**: A Node.js backend using Express and Prisma for handling user authentication and database operations.
- **auth-front**: A React frontend with TypeScript for a responsive user interface to interact with the authentication system.

The project serves as a practical example for developers to study and implement secure authentication workflows.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Supports user registration and login using email and password.
- **Secure Backend**: Utilizes Prisma ORM for database management and Express for API endpoints, with secure password handling.
- **Responsive Frontend**: Built with React and TypeScript, providing a clean and modern user interface for authentication flows.
- **RESTful API**: Backend provides RESTful endpoints for user management and authentication.
- **Type-Safe Development**: Frontend leverages TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience.
